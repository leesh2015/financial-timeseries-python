## 📖 Chapter Details

### Chapter 1: Linear Algebra

**Core Analogy**: "Cocktail Recipe"
- Vector: Amount of each ingredient [Gin 30ml, Tonic 90ml, Lime 10ml]
- Matrix: Compatibility chart between ingredients (covariance matrix)
- Eigenvalue decomposition: Extract core flavors (PCA)

**Key Topics**:
- Portfolio variance calculation: σ² = wᵀΣw
  - This formula calculates **"how risky is this cocktail?"**
  - Foundation of MVO (Mean-Variance Optimization) and factor models
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:
  - Compresses movements of hundreds of stocks into a few key factors like 'market', 'interest rates', 'oil prices'
- Meaning and calculation of covariance matrices
- Matrix operations in Fama-French factor models
- Matrix representation and estimation of VAR & VECM models

### Chapter 2: Analysis & Calculus

**Core Analogy**: "Descending a mountain in fog"
- Derivative: Speedometer (measuring rate of change) - "How fast is the price/error changing at this moment?"
- Gradient descent: Feeling the slope with your feet to descend to the lowest valley (minimum error)
- Backpropagation: Propagating errors backward to assign responsibility

**Key Topics**:
- Optimization through gradient descent
- **Deep Learning (Backpropagation)**:
  - Principle of how LSTM learns. Differentiates prediction errors to assign responsibility and adjust weights
- Calculus principles in GARCH models
- **Ito's Lemma**:
  - Formula for calculating the rate of change of option prices when stock prices jump randomly (Brownian motion)

### Chapter 3: Probability & Time Series Statistics

**Core Analogy**: "Predicting the future from past weather"
- Stationarity: Spring (property of returning to original position) - fundamental premise of time series analysis
- Cointegration: Owner and dog (connected by a leash) - seem to move independently but ultimately move together due to long-term equilibrium

**Key Topics**:
- Stationarity testing (ADF Test)
- Probabilistic foundations of ARIMA models
- **ARIMA / GARCH**:
  - Statistically estimates patterns of past data (AR), errors (MA), and volatility (GARCH)
- Cointegration and pair trading
- **Copula**:
  - **"Panic Room Effect"**: Models tail dependence where assets that normally move independently all crash together during crises
- Probability distributions in GARCH models

### Chapter 4: Bayesian Statistics & Filtering

**Core Analogy**: "Narrowing down suspects with new clues"
- Bayesian inference: Detective investigation - starts with many suspects (prior probability), updates probability of the real culprit (posterior probability) as evidence (data) emerges
- Kalman Filter: Navigation (combining GPS + speed) - combines noisy GPS signals (observations) with car speed (model) to estimate 'true position'

**Key Topics**:
- Bayesian update (prior → posterior probability)
- State estimation with Kalman Filter
- **State-Space Models**:
  - Tracks unobserved 'true market beta'
- **Prophet**:
  - Flexibly decomposes trends and seasonality using Bayesian methods to predict the future
- Bayesian structure of Prophet model
